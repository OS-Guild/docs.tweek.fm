Tweek use RSA keys for communication between the services, and for accessing git storage.

### Generating keys

In order to generate this keys, use the script in Tweek repo:
``https://github.com/Soluto/tweek/blob/master/utils/generate_keys.sh``

### Mounting the keys
In each service you should mount the relevant files, and configure the service using environment variables:

- GIT (public)  
  - PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=/run/secrets/id_rsa.pub
- API (pfx)
  - PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=/run/secrets/certificate.pfx
- Editor (private)
  - GIT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/run/secrets/id_rsa
- Authoring (private, public)
  - GIT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=/run/secrets/id_rsa.pub
  - GIT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/run/secrets/id_rsa
- Management (private, public)
  - GIT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=/run/secrets/id_rsa.pub
  - GIT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/run/secrets/id_rsa

### Linking Git repository

Authoring and management services should both have references to Git repo:

- Authoring
  - GIT_USER=git
  - GIT_URL=ssh://git@git/tweek/repo
Management
  - GIT_USER=git
  - GIT_URL=ssh://git@git/tweek/repo

### Linking Between services

Most services are configured by default to talk to each other, but if you want to customize it:

- Api 
  - -> Management - Rules__Management__Url=http://management:3000
- Editor 
  - -> Api - TWEEK_API_HOSTNAME=http://api
  - -> Authoring - AUTHORING_API_HOSTNAME=http://authoring:3000
  - -> Management - MANAGEMENT_HOSTNAME=http://management:3000
- Management
  - -> Api - VALIDATION_URL=http://api/validation

### Example configurations
You can checkout [dev](https://github.com/Soluto/tweek/blob/master/deployments/dev) folder for compose/swarm configuration docker-compose.  

There's a also a [Kubernetes example](https://github.com/Soluto/tweek/tree/master/deployments/kubernetes)
